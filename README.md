# 🌤️ Streamlit App — Built with Purpose and Sincerity

### About

This Streamlit app is part of a personal journey — blending technology, reflection, and purpose.
It’s not just a web application; it’s an experiment in turning ideas into light — **“truth through code.”**

The project stands on three principles:

1. **Simplicity** — keep the interface clear and accessible.
2. **Integrity** — data and functions must serve truth, not vanity.
3. **Intention** — every line of code is written *lillahi ta‘ala*, for the sake of learning and benefiting others.
